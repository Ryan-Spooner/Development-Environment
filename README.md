# DevEnv
_Quickly set up a CLI development environment_

## Purpose
This repository is a reference and tool for creating lightweight
development environments on Debian-based Linux and MacOS systems.
Apart from storing useful configurations and documenting steps
and procedures, the vision for DevEnv is to automate as much of
the process as possible.

## Toolchain
- ### Neovim
	- A powerful and highly configurable CLI text editor
- ### Tmux
	- An efficent and feature-rich terminal multiplexer
- ### Pyenv
	- Easily manage multiple version of Python
- ### Pyenv-Virtualenv
	- A tool for creating isolated virtual Python environments
*Note: DevEnv is a work in progress, and the above list is not
exhaustive. More features and components will be added, e.g.,
	- VM management
	- Containerization and orchestration
	- Infrastructure provisioning and configuration management
	- CI/CD
	- Logging and monitoring*
